Some helpful details about zyBook's [Data Science Foundations with Python](https://www.zybooks.com/catalog/data-science-foundations-python/) which is our primary textbook.
- [Get help with the zyBook here](https://zybooks.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) ... send questions about the course content to me scook@tarleton.edu
- I will insert links to external resources in the zyBook and mark as either required or optional reading.
- You will lose access after the course ends. Download pdf copies for your future use. They aren't interactive but will still have all the material.
- Some CA and zyLab problems offer "development" vs "submission" modes.
  - development - not graded, tracked, or save ... run as many time as you want
  - submission - submit to autograder ... all submissions coutned and the last 5 are saved.
    - I don't intend to limit # of submissions
    - but I also don't want you to simply guess and check until your code is accepted. This usually backfires - you don't actually understand what your mistakes were are are therefore doomed to repeat them.
